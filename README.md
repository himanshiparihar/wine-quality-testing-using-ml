The dataset is related to white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). randomforest and decision tree classifier algorithms used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. 

accuracy:

 decision tree classifier: 0.87
 randomforest : 0.82
